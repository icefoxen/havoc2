We should be able to give literals of 0xFF00 instead of, say, -0x100...
 -- Maybe an unsigned label, so we could say 0xFF00u?  Hm.
Hopefully we would correctly handle relative jumps to labels...  We need to be
able to do math to literals, then we could make a relative jump to "foo" just
be "jf (foo - $)" where $ is the current address... hmmm.
Make sure 'get' and 'set' to system registers work properly, and using system
registers in normal instructions and vice versa gives an error.
Make sure all the register aliases (sp, lp, over (op?), etc) work correctly
and are consistent between the assembler and VM.


WONT FIX:
The file MUST end in a newline...
 -- Would fix it if I knew how, but I can't see a reasonable way of doing so.
