Things to fix:
Command line args
Anything with XXX near it
Some instructions are still incomplete/unimplemented
Most instructions are untested
System calls are a bit janky
LOAD and STORE system calls seem to load/store in native byte order, which is not
necessarily what one would expect; files should be bags of bytes
System calls directly access memory with no checks which can be bad
System call and other user documentation could be better
Errors are a bit vague and don't drop you into the interpreter
Cleanup doesn't happen correctly in the various cases where exit() is called
Debugger is a tad wussy
Need an assembler!
Need a 'get # of instructions executed' syscall instead of printing it out at the
end.
Debugger commands to directly invoke syscalls?
Normal or wide strings?
A few things in cpu.h or such might be better off in misc.h
